Browser first renders on virtual view port, it is wider than target device and shrinks this page to a point it fits desired size. 

Why broswer does this?
Many pages are not mobile optimized and breaks when rendered at small width.
Browser attempt to make non mobile optimized website look better on mobile devices.

No.

So, How to solve it?
use viewport meta tag and media queries

What is a viewport meta tag?
meta tag with name viewport
<meta  name="viewport" content="Width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

What is significance of Width=device-width?
width of virtual viewport = same as desired device width
